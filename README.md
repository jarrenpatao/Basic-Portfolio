# Basic-Portfolio

Basic Portfolio created entirely through HTML and CSS. With this first assignment at UC Berkeley's Coding Boot Camp, I was able to learn how to apply containers along with their size, placement, and style.

### Dependencies

- Internet browser or compatible program to run HTML files
- IDE
  -  Any Integrated Development Environment will suffice
  
### Progression

You may view the next iteration of my portfolio [here](https://jarrenpatao.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).
You may view the source code for that portfolio [here](https://www.github.com/jarrenpatao/Bootstrap-Portfolio/).

You can see the progress in development from just basic HTML/CSS to HTML/CSS with Twitter Bootstrap's CDN for it's grid layout.
